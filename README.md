# DBSCAN



1. exercise in using numpy, pandas, and recursive logic, 
2. less about performance more about understanding the concept
2. handles arbitrarily shaped clusters well (concavity, links, voids, rings etc)
3. currently hyperparameters need to be manually adjusted according to data. 
4. next stage: automating hyperparameters and improve speed
